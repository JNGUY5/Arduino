Above is the link to a website... I think it's in Google Drive. Anyways, this is the Arduino Handbook, and will be very important and useful when coding or using Arduino.
## Setup/Don't Forget!
>Check the ports! Go to devices and printers, then go to the bottom and look at the port. Then go to arduino, click _tools_, then _Port:_, then make sure or change it so that the arduino port matches the computers listed port.

>Check the board type! Go to _tools_ under the toolbar, go and click on _board:_, and make sure you select the board type _nano_.

>After following these steps, the code on the computer should work.


### _Before November 1st_ : 

>The couple weeks before November 1st were mainly a discovery phase of the project for us. Jason and I (Anees) spent lots of time trying to understand the way the wires worked on the board and struggled a bit when we got started, to find a button that actually worked whn it was pressed. Eventually we became comfortable with the way the nanoboard works and we started working with the Simpe_PB_LED_V1 file. After editing this file for a while, we decided on a new goal to switch around the way it works and try to get the light to switch off when the button is let go of.

_**November 1st**_ : 

>Today we worked on the bread board and got the light press the right way. We tried figuring it out how to switch it from the light flashing when not pressed and not flashing when it is pressed. We were informed that instead of just coding it, we could use the code that was already included for it. We also expanded our knowledge of the breadboard by seeing how the current flows. We took out a connection and made a longer "chain " or connection going with 4 extra _"cables"/wires_. This was very impressive to us. Also with the code we have this glitch that everyone should have where when you press it sometimes a panel bounces and it would stay on instead of turning off when the button is pressed.  

_**November 8th**_ : 

>Today was much more of a formatting and getting organized period for us than anything else. We fully updated our GitHub repo, upload 3 pictures **that can be seen below**, and we are much more confident with our project now that we have a log to keep track of our commits. We started discussing how we could edit the Toggle file on Arduino so that the light does not bounce every time we press it quickly. Overall, today was very productive and our goal for next week is to fix the bouncing problem once and for all. After that, we aren't really sure what to do.

A screenshot of the code we used for the "push and hold for light" is below:

_**November 15th**_ : 

>This may not be compeletely complete, but it may. Today I (Jason) added a bunch of things to the readme and repo. I added files so that I will no longer have to look through the computer to access code. I also added the handbok to the readme. I also was working on using miliseconds instead of delay. I have been told this way is better because delay shuts stuff down and can be frustrating in groups. I used milliseconds in this and understand this. I seaved this seperately and added the file with the end name "milliseconds".

_**November 22nd**_ : 

>Today, we mainly made changed to our GitHub repo (and a slight edit to understand the milliseconds vs delay issue), and we believe that our repo is very detailed as well as our readme file that you are currently reading. GitHub has been extremely useful for this Arduino Nano project in fact we've really enjoyed decorating our readme, and we think it looks really crisp and clean.

_**November 29th**_ : 

>Unfortunately, this work period was probably the least productive of all... It's not that we didn't try to do anything, but that none of our attempts worked. We were attempting to get 6 LEDs working with 3 inputs on the board, as explained in the Issues and Projects tabs of this repository. We struggled a lot and still have not figured it out. Next week we will try to finish this.
